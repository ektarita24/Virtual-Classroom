<p style="border:groove;background-color:#FFFFCC"><br />At Virtual Classroom we believe that everyone is entitled to the education that they want. The reason that many people cannot 
    access the education they want is lack of access. Virtual Classroom offers one solution to this problem. It can provide a classroom for one person or many people. We can provide a teacher or you can. Pupils can be of any age, of any race, in any place throughout the world.
    <br />
    <br />
The Classroom has a teacher present in all but the physical aspects.<br /></p>

<p style="border:groove;background-color:#FFFFCC"><br />Virtual in the case of Virtual Classroom means that the teacher is not physically present in the classroom. The teacher is present on a screen. The advanced technology that we use comprises hardware and software that securely give the teacher control of the classroom. 
    The teacher can see and hear all the pupils and can decide what the pupils can see and hear at all times.<br /></p>

<p style="border:groove;background-color:#FFFFCC"><br />The classroom can be a traditional classroom and we are very successfully using such a model in both the United States and in Finland. 
    However you are not confined to such a model. 
    The classroom may comprise several rooms -some with many people present- scattered throughout the world. 
    The teacher has simultaneous access to all rooms as they also have to the teacher.<br /></p>
